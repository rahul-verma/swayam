Here\u2019s a comprehensive packing list to help you prepare:\n\n### Clothing\n1. **Lightweight Clothing**: June can be warm and humid, so pack breathable, lightweight clothing such as cotton or linen shirts, t-shirts, and shorts.\n2. **Layering Options**: Bring a light jacket or cardigan for cooler evenings or air-conditioned places.\n3. **Rain Gear**: Since June is part of the rainy season, pack a compact umbrella or a waterproof rain jacket.\n4. **Comfortable Shoes**: Bring comfortable walking shoes, as you\u2019ll likely be doing a lot of walking. Consider sandals or breathable sneakers.\n5. **Dressy Outfit**: If you plan to dine at upscale restaurants or attend events, include a nicer outfit.\n6. **Swimwear**: If you plan to visit a hotel pool or onsen (hot spring), pack a swimsuit.\n\n### Accessories\n7. **Sunglasses and Hat**: Protect yourself from the sun while exploring.\n8. **Daypack or Tote Bag**: A small backpack or tote for daily outings to carry essentials.\n9. **Reusable Water Bottle**: Stay hydrated while exploring the city.\n\n### Toiletries\n10. **Travel-sized Toiletries**: Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste, etc. (Note: many hotels provide basic toiletries.)\n11. **Sunscreen**: Protect your skin from UV rays.\n12. **Personal Medications**: Bring any necessary medications and a small first-aid kit.\n\n### Electronics\n13. **Power Adapter**: Japan uses Type A and Type B plugs, so bring a suitable power adapter.\n14. **Portable Charger**: Keep your devices charged while on the go.\n15. **Camera or Smartphone**: Capture your memories, along with any necessary chargers.\n\n### Travel Essentials\n16. **Travel Documents**: Passport, visa (if required), travel insurance, and copies of important documents.\n17. **Cash and Credit Cards**: While credit cards are accepted in many places, some smaller shops and restaurants may only take cash.
